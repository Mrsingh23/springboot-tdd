  Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual production code. 

## This repo provides testing practice for: 
 1) Unit Tetsing
 2) Integration Testing
 
## TDD Strategy
  * Write Test: Start by writing a test that specifies the behavior or functionality 
  * Run Test : Execute the test and ensure that it fails. This indicates that the feature 
  or functionality you're testing does not exist yet, so the test is expected to fail.
  * Write Code : Implement the necessary code to make the test pass. Keep the code as minimal as possible to satisfy the test requirements.
  * Run the Test Again
  * Refactor 
  * Repeat
